# Solution Tester
CLI application in C++ to compare results generated from different approaches on various test case.

## Getting started
```
input_generator.cpp - Generates input test cases(input_test_case.txt)
solution.cpp        - Generates two file containing solutions(brute_force_result.txt, optimized_result.txt)
compare.cpp         - Compare these files(brute_force_result.txt, optimized_result.txt)  
```

### Test
1. Given a number n, return sum of 1+2+3+...+n.
2. Given a list of n numbers, reverse and print.
3. Given a string, reverse and print it.
